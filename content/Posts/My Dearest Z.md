How fares my heart, my love, in the shadowed cloister of its own solitude? When the cold and the dark descend, whom do I summon in the silent cry of my soul? Who tends the wounds of this trembling spirit, torn by the weight of its own longing? Oh, my beloved, you who are both my affliction and my cure, I stand now in a strength that defies the frailty of my being, an unshakable faith that burns within me, as though it were the very pulse of existence itself—a motive, a singular striving to draw near to you, though you remain ever distant, ever elusive.

I no longer grasp at the possession of a life entwined with yours, as once I did in my reckless presumption. That was my error, my sin against the eternal. I should not have sought to bind you to me, to claim what can only be offered in freedom. Oh, how I should have taken your hands with the resolve of one who knows the divine weight of such a gesture! How I should have gazed unflinchingly into those piercing eyes, those mirrors of the infinite, wherein I glimpsed both my despair and my salvation! My soul cries out for those eyes, which once beheld me and in beholding made me whole.

Yet what is this longing but a paradox, a striving toward that which I cannot possess, yet cannot relinquish? In the dialectic of my heart, I am suspended—neither possessing you nor released from you, neither in despair nor in hope, but in that trembling space where faith alone sustains me. You are my enigma, my eternal question, and though I stand stronger than ever before, it is a strength born of surrender, a courage forged in the renunciation of my own will. I am yours, not in possession, but in the infinite resignation that loves without demand, that sees without claiming, that weeps without ceasing.

Ever yours in the paradox of faith,
