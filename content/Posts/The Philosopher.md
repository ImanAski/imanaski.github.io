You are the person who is living in my mind since the day I met you. You were a philosopher whose words were the way I thought. To be honest sometimes I wish I could just say the words that were in mind. I really miss you when you are away. Last night, I felt that something that was unusual. The lack of our language in our conversation on the phone. It was like I was just someone from far away. I am hearing strings that are detaching between us. Whenever I was down. you were the one who could hear me out. When I was talking to you I've had this feeling of not being alone, But now I can't do anything, Everything will be against me at some point cuase you'll have something to say.
You were always beautiful to me, because although I could see your fears and doubts, But also I could see your pure intentions and struggles to overcome those fears and doubts. At this point it doesn't matter where you go or what you do. There is always one 'H' living in my heart.
It is always irony to think about the first time I saw you. I was "lost" and didn't know where to find other guys we were hanging with. And then I saw you. It was like all my fears were gone at a glance, And the next thing I knew was that you were leading me to the right place.
