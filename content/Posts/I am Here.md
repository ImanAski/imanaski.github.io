I am here as I am writing this piece of text. I am facing all the past mistakes I've had created. It doesn't matter if they were wrong or right, because the person who is going to face the consequences is me. As I am floating down the river of dreams and thoughts, I have to fight for not losing the reality. I have good friends beside me for this fight, And I have enemies. one of the most dangerous and revenge-seeking enemies I've got is myself. I've always told you that at the end of the day this fight is within me and between myself and I. It's kind of ironic that the only thing I have to do against dreaming wildly is dreaming, But constrainted.
